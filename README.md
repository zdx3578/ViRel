[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00590) | [Poster](https://github.com/snap-stanford/virel/blob/master/poster.pdf) | [Project Page](http://snap.stanford.edu/virel/)

This is the official repo for [ViRel: Unsupervised Visual Relations Discovery with Graph-level Analogy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00590) (Zeng et al. ICML 2022 Beyond Bayes Workshop). ViRel is a method for unsupervised discovery and learning of visual relations with graph-level analogy.


Abstract:

We introduce Visual Relations with graph-level analogy (ViRel), a method for unsupervised discovery and learning of visual relations with graph-level analogy. In a grid-world based dataset that test visual relation reasoning, it achieves above 95% accuracy in unsupervised relation classification, discovers the relation graph structure for most tasks, and further generalizes to unseen tasks with more complicated relational structures.


Installation
==========================================================================
First clone the directory. Then run the following command to initialize the submodules:

```bash
git submodule init; git submodule update
```
(If you encounter a "no permission" error, you may need to [add a new SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).)

This repository also has the following dependencies:

- `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>` >= 1.9.1
- `pytorch-geometric <https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric>` >= 2.0.1
- networkx >= 2.6.3

The included `environment.yml` file can be used to create a conda environment with all dependencies installed:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate virel
```

# Dataset
The dataset files can be generated using the BabyARC engine in the `BabyARC` submodule.
A example generated dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dZhT1cUFGvivJbSTwnqjou2uilLXffGY/view) for the 3 object, 1 distractor object setting.

# Running
To run the code, use the following command:

```bash
python relation_analogy.py
```

To specify the hyperparameters, pass in the path to the .yaml file config, such as:

```bash
python relation_analogy.py --yaml config/main1.yaml
```
More example yaml config files can be found in the `config` subdirectory.

The hyperparameters can also be passed in via command line, see `get_default_args` in `args.py` for all possible args to pass in. If an arg is not passed in, the default value will be used in `get_default_args`. Specifying an arg in the .yaml file will take precedence over passing in command line values.
